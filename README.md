### Description

This is a draggable toolwindow inside another window. Normally windows can only be inside an MDI form, but this is a great control which looks and acts like a real window. Completely customizable!!! If you plan to place many toolwindows inside a form, try duplicating the source files and adding each toolwindow as a separate toolwindow so you can customize them according to your needs. [ See another demonstration of this control in my other project: City Builder (txtCodeId=57486&lngWId=1)]
